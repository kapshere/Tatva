# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) - Prototype (v1)

## 1. Project Planning
- Define project scope and objectives
- Identify stakeholders
- Initial timeline and resource planning

## 2. Requirements Gathering
- Identify core user personas (Learner, Educator, Employer)
- Document essential features for prototype

## 3. Design
- Basic UI/UX wireframes for landing, profile, and connection screens
- Define decentralized data flow (BAP/BPP interaction)

## 4. Core Development
- User registration & login (email-based, mock decentralized ID)
- Profile creation (basic info, skills, education, experience)
- Search/browse users (by skill, education, employer)
- Basic connection request/accept/reject
- Minimal BAP/BPP BECKN protocol implementation (mocked)

## 5. Testing
- Unit and integration tests for core flows
- Manual UAT checklist

## 6. Demo & Documentation
- Prepare demo script
- Basic documentation for prototype

---

**Scope:**
- Focus on demonstrating decentralized interaction and user data ownership
- No production-ready BECKN integration, only mocked flows
- Minimal UI, focus on core flows for pre-seed demo
