## Project Plan for Tatva: A LinkedIn Alternative for Education and Skilling

Overview
Tatva will be developed in three key phases aligned with your funding strategy:

Prototype (v1): Essential features to demonstrate concept and secure pre-seed funding
MVP (v2): Core functionality that delivers value to early adopters and attracts seed funding
Beta (v3): Comprehensive feature set with scalability to support Series A funding

Let me break down each phase with the corresponding work items, user stories, and testing criteria.
