Building a Unified BAP/BPP Platform for ONEST: A LinkedIn Alternative for Education and Skilling
1. Introduction
The digital ecosystem for education and skilling is rapidly evolving, presenting new opportunities for connecting learners, educators, and employers. The Open Network for Education and Skilling Transformation (ONEST) leverages the BECKN protocol to create an open, interoperable network that democratizes access to educational and employment opportunities. This report proposes a design and architecture for a unified Buyer Application Platform (BAP) and BECKN Provider Platform (BPP) application specifically tailored for the ONEST ecosystem, serving as an alternative to LinkedIn with a focus on education, skills development, and career advancement.
Unlike traditional platforms that function as centralized intermediaries, our proposed solution will leverage the decentralized nature of the BECKN protocol to connect individuals seeking learning and employment opportunities (seekers) directly with educational institutions, training providers, and employers (providers). By combining both BAP and BPP functionalities within a single application, we aim to create a versatile platform where users can seamlessly switch between seeking opportunities and offering services, enabling a more dynamic and collaborative ecosystem for education and professional growth.
2. Understanding the ONEST Ecosystem
2.1 ONEST Overview
ONEST (Open Network for Education and Skilling Transformation) is an implementation of the Digital Skilling and Education Protocol (DSEP) built on the BECKN protocol. It aims to create an open network that connects seekers of educational and employment opportunities with providers of these services, including educational institutions, training organizations, and employers.
The ONEST ecosystem encompasses several key domains:
1.Learning Experiences: Courses, certifications, and educational content
2.Mentorship: Connections with industry professionals and academic mentors
3.Work Opportunities: Jobs, internships, and gig work
4.Financial Support: Scholarships, loans, and grants for education
5.Assessments: Skill evaluations and certifications
2.2 Target Users and Use Cases
Our unified BAP/BPP platform will serve diverse users within the ONEST ecosystem:
As BAP users (Seekers):
Students searching for educational courses and certification programs
Job seekers looking for employment opportunities
Professionals seeking skill development and mentorship
Individuals requiring financial assistance for education
As BPP users (Providers):
Educational institutions offering courses and certifications
Individual trainers and educators providing specialized courses
Employers posting job opportunities and internships
Mentors offering guidance and coaching services
Financial institutions providing educational loans and scholarships
Key use cases include:
Discovering and enrolling in educational courses
Searching for and applying to job opportunities
Offering courses and educational content as an educator
